## About me

Iâ€™m a multi-disciplined Architect with over two decades of experience spanning various client, server and cloud infrastructure technologies.
Experienced at deploying, supporting, and managing the infrastructure and platform components that provide the foundation to build and run business applications.

These days I work extensively with the following and more:

* Cloud Provider(s): AWS
* Kubernetes: AWS EKS
* CI/CD: ArgoCD, CodeFresh, and GitHub Actions
* Language(s): Go
* Databases: AWS RDS, DynamoDB
* Cache engines: ElastiCache
* IaC: Terraform
* Scaling: KEDA, and Karpenter
* Managing Secrets: Vault, vault-injector, External Secrets Operator
* Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, NewRelic, Cloudwatch
* Tooling: kubebuilder, skaffold, goreleaser, golangci-lint, govulncheck, gosec, betteralign, staticcheck, revive, identypo, nakedret, checkov, trivy, copa, syft, grype, semgrep, tfsec, gitleaks, trufflehog, and more.


## Diverse roles I've held

### Senior Cloud Engineer
* Built Kubernetes Operators using Go.

### GKE Kubernetes Cluster administrator
* Lead cluster migration from OpenStack VMs to GKE and GitLab for CI.
* Maintained a set of helm charts responsible for the workloads created from the Gitlab CI process. That task inspired this WebProject [Operator](https://github.com/chaunceyt/webproject-operator).
* Provided support for: Docker, Docksal, Apache, PHP, NodeJS, Gatsby, Mysql, Mariadb, Redis, Memcached, Varnish, Solr and a number of other tools. As a result of using Redis for years, I created this simple [operator](https://github.com/chaunceyt/redis-operator)

### Platform Architect
* Maintained compute infrastructure using Ansible as configuration management tool.
* Implemented the CI/CD automation and managed the deployment of software and configuration to production environments.
* Performed planned and unplanned failover to standby data centers testing disaster recovery plan runsheet
* Maintained a number Teleport clusters ([notes](https://github.com/chaunceyt/teleport) I keep about this tool as I was learning to manage it)

### Release Manager
* Built infra that monitored commits to master for multiple Git repos and backported that to other environments using automation.
* Managed the hand-off of code for upcoming production releases developed by various teams.
* Communicated with internal and external stakeholders about the completion of application distributions.

### Tech Lead/InfraOps support
* Provided GitLab CI and operation support for project teams.
* Developed AWS Cloudformation templates used to provision the AWS infrastructure. 
* Responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of multiple project AWS environments running workloads using ECS, Aurora Mariadb, EFS, Redis ElastiCache, API Gateway, and Lambda.
* Responsible for code and/or configuration deployments to multiple client production environments.
* Performed full client site migrations to/from Blackmesh/Contegix, Acquia, Pantheon, and AWS.
* Developed Ansible roles responsible for managing the configuration of production VMs
